# Single-Cell-Transcriptomic-Analysis-of-Immune-Markers-in-Cervical-Cancer
The objective of this analysis is to explore the immune landscape and tumor microenvironment (TME) in cervical cancer through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. By focusing on the expression of key immune markers, I aimed to characterize the different immune cell populations present within the tumor
